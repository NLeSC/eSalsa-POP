eSalsa POP
==========


What is it?

developed as part of the eSalsa Project.

What is the eSalsa Project?
---------------------------

The eSalsa Project is a cooperation between the Netherlands eScience 
Center (NLeSC), the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (IMAU) 
at Utrecht University, and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU). 

The goal of the eSalsa project is to determine to what extent regional sea 
level in the eastern North Atlantic will be affected by changes in ocean 
circulation over the next decades.

During the project we will improve and extend POP with support for 
distributed computing techniques and accelerators (GPUs).
