The eSalsa version of POP contains an extra configuration option
for the processor configuration (as described in Section 3.1.1 
of the POP user guide). 

In the domain namelist (&domain_nml) contains two options for the 
baroclinic and barotropic block distributions:

  clinic_distribution_type 
  tropic_distribution_type

In the original POP, three options are available for these settings:

  cartesian
  balanced
  spacecurve

In the eSalsa version a fourth option is added:

  predefined

When this option is used, the block distribution is not determined at 
runtime, but read from a file instead. The location of this file can be 
set by adding the following option to the domain namelist:

  distribution_file='file'

where file is the path to a suitable work distribution file generated by 
the LoadBalancing tool in the eSalsa Tools package which can be found at:
